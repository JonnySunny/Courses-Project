In iteration 1:

1. Sometimes robot move abnormally when it has collision with obstacles or walls; Home base also has the same problem, work on it later.
2. When dealing with win and lose, just print sentences on the terminal to make users notice that and quit, which is not I expected, so I will work on it later.
3. Visualize battery level via changing the color of robot
4. Donâ€™t know how to deplete Battery by angular speed. The base depletion and linear depletion is implemented
