-------------------------------------------------
Purpose:
To count and sum the votes from different layers. For example, there're subcounty, county and region, 3 layers. so the program will count the subcouty first and then put in couty, then count then put on region, then count region, and find the winner at last.


-------------------------------------------------
To compile the program and usage:
Since there's a makefile. so just type "make" in terminal. 
and then input tree arguments such as  ./votecounter input.txt inputdir outputdir


-------------------------------------------------
What the program does:
First of all, read the input.txt. Knowing the relation of each node, and then build directrories according to this structure.
Then, we created numer of leaf thread to run our main functionality, which is to find the winner in those files.
There are three functions that are included in a function called "childthread". Thread needs to run those functions to get the result. 
LogStart and LogEnd function are used to record the thread id and correspnded name each thread takes over.
The Decry function is used to decipher the files which are provided in the inputdir.
The aggregate function is used to merge all non-leaf node file correctly, and we can find the winner in the text file of the root directory.
We use lock in the aggregate function to control the writing and reading between threads.
